# How to Contribute

This is just a issue reproducer, so contributions are unlikely to be
needed.

But if you do have contributions, it might be better to submit contributions
to the upstream bionic project (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/refs/heads/main)
via Gerrit (see: https://source.android.com/docs/setup/contribute/submit-patches)
